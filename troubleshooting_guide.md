# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter when using Doc Detective. If you're experiencing problems with installation, configuration, or test execution, you'll find helpful information here.

## Installation Issues

### Docker Installation Fails

If you're having trouble installing Docker for the VSCode Dev Container:

1. Ensure your system meets the [Docker system requirements](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Check if virtualization is enabled in your BIOS settings.
3. If using Windows, make sure Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled.

### Node.js Installation Problems

For manual installation issues with Node.js:

1. Verify that you're downloading the correct version for your operating system.
2. Try using a node version manager like `nvm` to install and manage Node.js versions.
3. If you encounter permission errors, avoid using `sudo` to install global packages. Instead, [change npm's default directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

## Configuration Errors

### VSCode Dev Container Fails to Build

If the Dev Container fails to build:

1. Ensure Docker is running on your system.
2. Check your internet connection, as the container needs to download dependencies.
3. Try running `docker system prune` to clear any cached images that might be causing conflicts.

### npm Dependencies Fail to Install

When `npm install` fails:

1. Clear the npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
3. Check for any conflicting global packages that might interfere with the installation.

## Test Execution Failures

### Tests Fail to Run

If your tests aren't running:

1. Ensure you're in the correct directory when running the tests.
2. Check that all required dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
3. Verify that your test files are in the correct location and named according to the project's conventions.

### Unexpected Test Results

For unexpected test outcomes:

1. Review your test cases and ensure they're up to date with the latest code changes.
2. Check for any environment-specific issues, such as file paths or environment variables.
3. Use debugging tools to step through the test execution and identify where the unexpected behavior occurs.

## Interpreting Error Messages and Logs

### Common Error Messages

- "Module not found": Indicates a missing dependency. Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed.
- "SyntaxError": Check the indicated file and line number for syntax issues like missing brackets or semicolons.
- "TypeError": Often occurs when trying to use a value of the wrong type. Check your variable assignments and function parameters.

### Analyzing Logs

1. Look for stack traces in the error output to identify where the error occurred.
2. Check the timestamps in the logs to correlate errors with specific actions or events.
3. Use log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) to filter and focus on the most relevant information.

## Getting Additional Help

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/doc-detective/issues) page to see if others have reported similar problems.
2. Search the project's documentation for any additional information related to your issue.
3. If all else fails, create a new GitHub issue with a detailed description of your problem, including steps to reproduce, error messages, and your environment details.

Remember to keep your Doc Detective installation up to date, as newer versions may include bug fixes and improvements that could resolve your issue.
