# Best Practices for Using Doc Detective

This guide provides a set of best practices to help you use Doc Detective effectively in your documentation workflow. By following these recommendations, you can create more robust tests, maintain an organized project structure, and seamlessly integrate Doc Detective into your documentation process.

## Writing Effective Tests

1. **Be specific**: Write tests that target specific elements or behaviors in your documentation. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues when tests fail.

2. **Use descriptive names**: Give your tests clear, descriptive names that indicate what they're checking. For example, "verify_login_button_exists" is more informative than "test_button".

3. **Keep tests atomic**: Each test should focus on a single aspect of your documentation. This makes it easier to identify the cause of failures and maintain your test suite.

4. **Use appropriate assertions**: Choose the right assertion for each test. Doc Detective provides various assertion types to check for different conditions.

5. **Include both positive and negative tests**: Don't just test for expected behavior; also test for error handling and edge cases.

6. **Use variables and parameterization**: Leverage variables and parameterized tests to make your tests more flexible and reusable across different scenarios.

## Organizing Test Files

1. **Group related tests**: Organize your tests into logical groups, either by feature, page, or documentation section.

2. **Use a consistent file naming convention**: Adopt a naming convention for your test files, such as `test_[feature].js` or `[feature]_spec.js`.

3. **Maintain a clear directory structure**: Organize your test files into directories that mirror your documentation structure or feature set.

4. **Separate test data**: Keep test data separate from test scripts. This makes it easier to update data without modifying test logic.

5. **Use config files**: Utilize configuration files to store environment-specific settings, making it easier to run tests across different environments.

## Integrating Doc Detective into Your Workflow

1. **Automate testing**: Set up continuous integration to run Doc Detective tests automatically on every pull request or commit.

2. **Version control your tests**: Keep your Doc Detective tests in version control alongside your documentation source files.

3. **Document your test strategy**: Maintain a document that outlines your testing approach, including what to test and how to write new tests.

4. **Regular maintenance**: Review and update your tests regularly to ensure they remain relevant as your documentation evolves.

5. **Collaborate with your team**: Encourage all team members to contribute to and maintain the test suite.

6. **Use test results to improve docs**: Analyze test results to identify areas of your documentation that need improvement or clarification.

## Example: Writing a Good Test

Here's an example of a well-structured Doc Detective test:

```javascript
{
  "name": "verify_installation_instructions",
  "description": "Checks if the installation instructions are complete and accurate",
  "test": [
    {
      "type": "exists",
      "selector": "h2:contains('Installation')"
    },
    {
      "type": "exists",
      "selector": "code:contains('npm install doc-detective')"
    },
    {
      "type": "notExists",
      "selector": "p:contains('TODO')"
    }
  ]
}
```

This test:
- Has a clear, descriptive name
- Includes a helpful description
- Checks for multiple aspects of the installation instructions
- Uses appropriate assertion types

By following these best practices, you can create a robust and maintainable test suite with Doc Detective, ensuring the quality and accuracy of your documentation over time.
