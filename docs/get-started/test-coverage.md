# Test Coverage

This guide explains how to use Doc Detective to calculate test coverage of your documentation content. You'll learn about the process, available options, and how to interpret the results.

## Overview

Doc Detective provides a powerful feature to analyze the test coverage of your documentation. This helps you identify areas that may need more testing or documentation improvements.

## Using the runCoverage Command

To calculate test coverage, you'll use the `runCoverage` command from the `src/index.js` file. Here's how to use it:

1. Ensure you have Doc Detective installed and set up in your project.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
npx doc-detective runCoverage
```

## Available Options

The `runCoverage` command supports several options to customize your coverage analysis:

- `--config`: Specify a custom configuration file path.
- `--output`: Define the output format (e.g., JSON, HTML).
- `--threshold`: Set a minimum coverage percentage threshold.

Example usage with options:

```bash
npx doc-detective runCoverage --config ./custom-config.json --output html --threshold 80
```

## Interpreting the Results

After running the coverage analysis, you'll receive a report with the following information:

1. Overall coverage percentage
2. Coverage breakdown by documentation section
3. List of untested or poorly tested areas
4. Suggestions for improving coverage

Use this information to identify areas that need more attention and to track your documentation testing progress over time.

## Best Practices

To make the most of Doc Detective's test coverage feature:

1. Run coverage analysis regularly as part of your documentation workflow.
2. Set a coverage threshold and gradually increase it as you improve your documentation.
3. Focus on critical areas of your documentation first.
4. Use the results to guide your documentation and testing efforts.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the coverage analysis:

1. Ensure you're using the latest version of Doc Detective.
2. Check your configuration file for any errors.
3. Verify that all required dependencies are installed.
